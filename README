# JS Game Engine

This is a simple browser-based game engine implemented using HTML5 Canvas.
It provides:

- Keyboard input handling
- Basic shapes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`)
- Support for image textures via the `Sprite` class
- An `Engine` class that updates and draws objects each frame

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the arrow keys to move the
red rectangle around. A circle and a sprite are also rendered as examples.
