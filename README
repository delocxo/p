# JS Game Engine

This is a simple browser-based game engine implemented using HTML5 Canvas.
It now includes a few extra utilities reminiscent of a very light version of
SFML. The engine provides:

- Keyboard and mouse input handling
- Basic shapes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`)
- Simple UI elements (`Text` and `Button`)
- Support for image textures via the `Sprite` class
- Collision detection helpers
- An `Engine` class that updates, checks collisions and draws objects each frame

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the arrow keys to move the red
rectangle around. If it touches the circle it turns blue. A button in the
bottom-right resets the rectangle's position.
